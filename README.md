# Identity_Detector
          This project is used for identifying if an intruder enters an organisation or a specific protected arena.
          Done by using ml, opencv and mail sending protocols.
          It identifies the person if he is trained and displays his details, else marks as unknown.
          If an unknown person is detected, a mail with the photo of the intruder and an sms will be sent to the authoritative owner.
